### 🔍 Analytics & Data Engineering Vibes

I enjoy collecting and analyzing data from real systems and making it speak:

- 📦 Worked with **Kafka** and event streams to process real-time data  
- 📈 Familiar with dashboarding using **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and log analysis  
- 🧪 Always curious to see **what's really going on under the hood**
